           ocaml-base - standard library extension for OCaml


This library is an extension of the OCaml standard library.  It provides
extended Array, Char, List, and String modules, data structures for
finite sets and finite maps based on binary trees of bounded balance,
dynamic arrays, priority queues based on array-embedded heaps, and some
utilities.

Additionally, ocaml-base contains a rather complete and efficient
monadic parser combinator library, similar to the Parsec library for
Haskell and the FParsec library for F#.


Requirements
------------

ocaml-base depends on the following tools and libraries:

- Regular expression support in ocaml-base relies on PCRE-OCaml [1].
  PCRE is currently used only by the CharStream and MParser modules, but
  the library cannot be loaded without it.

- Compilation is done using the included OCamlMakefile, which requires
  GNU Make.

- Installation uses the Findlib library manager [2].

ocaml-base has been tested with OCaml 3.10 and 3.12, but it should also
work with older or newer versions.


Installation
------------

Unpack in any directory, change to the newly created directory:

  $ tar zxvf ocaml-base-<version>.tar.gz
  $ cd ocaml-base-<version>

Build the libraries (byte-code and native):

  $ make

Build the documentation:

  $ make docs

Install the library with findlib:

  $ make install

Uninstall the library with findlib:

  $ make uninstall
